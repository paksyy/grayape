## Bring your own device policy

A BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policy governs how employees can use their personal devices (phones, laptops, tablets) to access corporate networks and data.

Security considerations:
- Enforce strong authentication (e.g., MFA)
- Require device encryption
- Use mobile device management (MDM)
- Restrict access based on role or location
- Monitor for malicious or non-compliant behavior

Benefits:
- Increased flexibility and user satisfaction
- Reduced hardware costs

Risks:
- Data leakage
- Malware introduction
- Non-compliant endpoints

## Network segmentation

Network segmentation is the practice of dividing a network into smaller subnetworks (segments) to improve performance and security.

Types:
- **Physical segmentation**: Using separate hardware (e.g., VLANs across switches).
- **Logical segmentation**: Using VLANs, ACLs, firewalls to control traffic.

Benefits:
- Limits lateral movement of attackers
- Improves network performance
- Enables role-based access control
- Helps contain malware or breaches to isolated segments

Common segments:
- User LAN
- Server VLAN
- Management network
- Guest Wi-Fi
- IoT/OT devices

Segmentation is a fundamental part of zero-trust architectures and defense-in-depth strategies.
