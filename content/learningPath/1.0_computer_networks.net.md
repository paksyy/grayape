*Computer networks rely on many devices, protocols, services, standards, etc. that enable us to communicate with one another.*

## OSI MODEL
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model was created to standardize and streamline communication between networked devices.

### OSI Reference Model
- **Layer 7 Application**: Provides network services directly to user applications (HTTP, FTP, SMTP)
- **Layer 6 Presentation**: Handles data formatting, encryption/decryption (SSL, JPEG)
- **Layer 5 Session**: Manages communication sessions between devices (RPC, NetBIOS)
- **Layer 4 Transport**: Ensures reliable data transfer (TCP, UDP)
- **Layer 3 Network**: Handles logical addressing and routing (IP, ICMP)
- **Layer 2 Data Link**: Physical addressing and error detection (Ethernet, MAC)
- **Layer 1 Physical**: Transmits raw bit streams over physical media (Copper, Fiber)

Most devices operate on more than one layer, but to determine which layer a device is operating on, you must first identify the highest layer it is functioning on.

## Network Devices

### Layer 1 Devices:
- **Analog modem**: Developed to create connections between network segments via PSTN using POTS. Provides single connection (56Kbps max).
- **Hub**: Functions as a concentrator/repeater. Operates in half-duplex, creates single collision domain. Mostly obsolete.

### Layer 2 Devices:
- **Switch**: Uses ASIC chips to learn MAC addresses and forward frames intelligently. Creates separate collision domains per port.
- **Wireless Access Point (WAP)**: Bridges wireless and wired networks. Implements 802.11 standards (Wi-Fi 6, etc.).

### Layer 3 Devices:
- **Multilayer Switch (MLS)**: Combines Layer 2 switching with Layer 3 routing capabilities. High-performance but expensive.
- **Router**: Connects different networks using IP addressing. Maintains routing tables (static/dynamic routes).

## Security Devices

### Firewall
Operates at Layers 2-4 and 7 with two inspection methods:
- **Stateless**: Simple packet filtering (ACLs)
- **Stateful**: Tracks connection state (more secure)

### Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
- **Signature-Based**: Matches known attack patterns
- **Anomaly-Based**: Detects deviations from baseline
- **Policy-Based**: Enforces admin-defined rules

### Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
Active system that can:
- Block malicious traffic
- Terminate connections
- Quarantine hosts
Best placed between firewall and internal network.

### VPN Concentrator
Specialized device for managing multiple VPN connections:
- Protocols: IPsec, SSL/TLS
- Functions: Authentication, encryption, access control
- Use cases: Remote access, site-to-site VPNs

## Optimization Devices
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic across servers (Round Robin, Least Connections)
- **Proxy Server**: Intermediary for client requests (Forward/Reverse proxies)

## (PRACTICAL) Basic monitoring

- nethog
- iptraf-ng

## Network Access Applications
- **VPN**: Secure remote access (IPsec, SSL)
- **Remote Access**: RDP, SSH, Telnet
- **Web Services**: HTTP/HTTPS, REST APIs
- **Unified Voice**: VoIP, SIP trunking

## VPN Protocols
- **IPsec**: Secure encrypted tunnels (IKE, ESP)
- **GRE**: Generic Routing Encapsulation (no encryption)
- **PPTP**: Obsolete (MS-CHAP vulnerabilities)
- **TLS/SSL**: Common in web-based VPNs

## Network Access Services
- **NIC**: Network Interface Card (Physical/MAC address)
- **RADIUS**: Centralized authentication (UDP 1812)
- **TACACS+**: Cisco alternative (TCP 49, more secure)

## DHCP
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to client devices. It simplifies network management by reducing the need for manual IP configuration.

- **Static IP**: Manually configured IP address that does not change over time. Useful for servers, printers, and other critical devices.
- **Dynamic IP**: Automatically assigned by the DHCP server from a predefined pool. The address may change when the lease expires or the device reconnects.
- **DHCP Process (DORA)**:
  - **Discover**: Client sends broadcast request to locate a DHCP server.
  - **Offer**: Server responds with an available IP address and configuration options.
  - **Request**: Client requests the offered IP from one of the servers.
  - **Acknowledgment**: Server confirms the lease and completes the configuration.
- **Ports**: DHCP communication uses **UDP port 67** (server) and **UDP port 68** (client).
- **Leases**: IP addresses are assigned for a limited period (lease time). Clients must renew leases before expiration to keep their IPs.
- **Options**: Additional parameters provided by the DHCP server, such as default gateway, DNS servers, domain name, NTP servers, and more.
- **Preferred IP configuration**: Clients can request a specific IP address, and the server may honor the request if available.
- **DHCP Relay (IP Helper)**: Allows DHCP requests to be forwarded across subnets to a central DHCP server. Common in large networks to avoid deploying a DHCP server per subnet.

## DNS
The Domain Name System (DNS) translates domain names into IP addresses. It is a critical component of network communication and internet functionality.

- **Servers**: Include root, TLD, authoritative, and caching resolvers. Resolve queries from users to locate websites or services.
- **Records**:
  - **A/AAAA**: IPv4/IPv6 address records.
  - **CNAME**: Alias for another domain.
  - **MX**: Mail exchange server.
  - **NS**: Delegates a subdomain to a DNS server.
  - **PTR**: Reverse DNS mapping.
  - **TXT**: Text records (e.g., SPF, DKIM).
- **Dynamic DNS**: Automatically updates DNS records in real-time when devices join or leave the network, useful in environments with frequently changing IPs.

## NAT (Network Address Translation)
- **Static NAT**: 1:1 mapping (public:private)
- **Dynamic NAT**: Pool of public addresses
- **PAT (Port NAT)**: Many private to single public
- **Address Types**: Public/Private, RFC 1918

## (PRACTICAL) Service Enumeration

- **dig**: A powerful DNS lookup tool for querying specific DNS records and analyzing DNS responses.
