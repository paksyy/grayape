*Computer networks rely on many devices, protocols, services, stardards, etc. that enable us to communicate with one another.*

## OSI MODEL
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model was created to standardize and streamline communication between networked devices. 
OSI Reference Model
- Layer 7 Application
- Layer 6 Presentation
- Layer 5 Session
- Layer 4 Transport
- Layer 3 Network
- Layer 2 Data Link
- Layer 1 Physical

Most devices operate on more than one layer, but to determine which layer a device is operating on, you must first identify the highest layer it is functioning on.

## Layer 1 Devices:

### Analog modem
They were devoleped to create connections betweem networks segmentes via the public switched telephone network (PTSN) using the plain old telephone system (POTS). Modems provide for a single connection to a network.

### Hub
A hub functions as a concentrator/repeater. It takes the electrical signal that arrives on a port and replicates that signal out of all the other ports. The hub is not very common in modern networking.

## Layer 2 Devices:

### Switch

A switch utilizes an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). The ASIC chip has specific programming that allows the switch to learn when a device is on the network and wich port it is connected to via the device's Layer 2 MAC address.

### Wireless Access Point (WAP)
A WAP is a specific type of network bridge that connects (bridges) wireless network segments with sired network segments.

## Layer 3 devices:

### Multilayer switch (MLS)
Provides normal layer 2 network switching services but it will also provide layer 3 or higher OSI model services, this devices can handle routing funcitions in comparison to the Layer 2 switch, is really expensive.

### Router
Is the most common network device for connecting different networks together utilizing the OSI model's layers 3 logical network information. The router uses software programming for decission making as compared to the switch's use of an ASIC chip.
The router uses this programming to leep track of different networks and what it considers to be the best possible route to reach those networks.
A router can communicate eith both local and non-local network devices


## Security devices

### Firewall
A firewall can be placed on routers or hosts (software based) or can bet its own device. It functions at multiple layers of the OSI model. Specifically at layers 2,3,4 and 7.
It block packets from entering or leaving the network.
- Via stateless inspection: Also known as packet filtering, this method examines each packet individually without considering the context of the traffic. It uses simple rules based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols. Because it does not track the state of connections, it is faster but less secure and more prone to false positives or false negatives.
- Via stateful inspection: This method tracks the state and context of network connections. It not only checks packet headers but also monitors the state of each session (e.g., TCP handshake). This allows the firewall to make more informed decisions about whether to allow or block traffic. Stateful inspection is more secure but requires more processing power.
It is the fist line of defense in protecting the internal network from outside threats

### Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
An IDS is a passive system designed to monitor network traffic or system activity for malicious actions or policy violations. Unlike firewalls, it does not actively block traffic but instead alerts administrators when suspicious activity is detected.
There are three main detection methods:
- Signature-Based Detection
This method compares traffic patterns against a database of known attack signatures. It is effective at detecting known threats but cannot identify new or unknown (zero-day) attacks.
- Anomaly-Based Detection
This approach establishes a baseline of normal behavior and flags deviations from this baseline as potential threats. It is useful for detecting novel or unknown attacks but may generate more false positives.
- Policy-Based Detection
This method relies on predefined security policies or rules created by administrators. Any activity that violates these policies is flagged. It is flexible and customizable but requires careful rule management.

### Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
An IPS is an active security system that monitors network or system traffic in real time and takes immediate action to stop malicious activity. Unlike an IDS, which only alerts, an IPS can intervene to prevent attacks before they cause harm.
An IPS can respond to threats in several ways:
Common Actions an IPS Can Take:
- Drop or block malicious packets
- Terminate suspicious connections
- Alert administrators
- Log details for forensics
- Quarantine compromised hosts
- Prevent access to certain IPs, ports, or protocols
- Redirect attack
The best placement on the network is between a router (with a firewall) and the destination network segment.

### Virtual Private Network (VPN) Concentrator
A VPN concentrator is a specialized network device used to manage and secure multiple VPN connections. It is designed to create, manage, and terminate encrypted tunnels between remote users or sites and a central network.
This device is essential in environments where many users need secure remote access at the same time, such as in large organizations or branch office connectivity.
Main Functions:
- Establish Secure Tunnels: Sets up encrypted communication using protocols like IPsec or SSL, protecting data in transit.
- User Authentication: Verifies the identity of users before allowing access, often using certificates, usernames/passwords, or multi-factor authentication.
- Traffic Encryption/Decryption: Ensures confidentiality and integrity of data by encrypting outgoing traffic and decrypting incoming traffic.
- Scalability: Supports hundreds or thousands of simultaneous VPN connections.
- Access Control: Enforces policies to ensure users can only reach authorized resources.
Common Use Cases:
- Secure remote access for employees working from home or traveling
- Site-to-site VPNs connecting different branch offices
- Centralized management of multiple VPN clients
