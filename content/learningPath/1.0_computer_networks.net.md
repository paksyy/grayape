*Computer networks rely on many devices, protocols, services, standards, etc. that enable us to communicate with one another.*

## OSI MODEL
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model was created to standardize and streamline communication between networked devices.

### OSI Reference Model
- **Layer 7 Application**: Provides network services directly to user applications (HTTP, FTP, SMTP)
- **Layer 6 Presentation**: Handles data formatting, encryption/decryption (SSL, JPEG)
- **Layer 5 Session**: Manages communication sessions between devices (RPC, NetBIOS)
- **Layer 4 Transport**: Ensures reliable data transfer (TCP, UDP)
- **Layer 3 Network**: Handles logical addressing and routing (IP, ICMP)
- **Layer 2 Data Link**: Physical addressing and error detection (Ethernet, MAC)
- **Layer 1 Physical**: Transmits raw bit streams over physical media (Copper, Fiber)

Most devices operate on more than one layer, but to determine which layer a device is operating on, you must first identify the highest layer it is functioning on.

## Network Devices

### Layer 1 Devices:
- **Analog modem**: Developed to create connections between network segments via PSTN using POTS. Provides single connection (56Kbps max).
- **Hub**: Functions as a concentrator/repeater. Operates in half-duplex, creates single collision domain. Mostly obsolete.

### Layer 2 Devices:
- **Switch**: Uses ASIC chips to learn MAC addresses and forward frames intelligently. Creates separate collision domains per port.
- **Wireless Access Point (WAP)**: Bridges wireless and wired networks. Implements 802.11 standards (Wi-Fi 6, etc.).

### Layer 3 Devices:
- **Multilayer Switch (MLS)**: Combines Layer 2 switching with Layer 3 routing capabilities. High-performance but expensive.
- **Router**: Connects different networks using IP addressing. Maintains routing tables (static/dynamic routes).

## Security Devices

### Firewall
Operates at Layers 2-4 and 7 with two inspection methods:
- **Stateless**: Simple packet filtering (ACLs)
- **Stateful**: Tracks connection state (more secure)

### Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
- **Signature-Based**: Matches known attack patterns
- **Anomaly-Based**: Detects deviations from baseline
- **Policy-Based**: Enforces admin-defined rules

### Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
Active system that can:
- Block malicious traffic
- Terminate connections
- Quarantine hosts
Best placed between firewall and internal network.

### VPN Concentrator
Specialized device for managing multiple VPN connections:
- Protocols: IPsec, SSL/TLS
- Functions: Authentication, encryption, access control
- Use cases: Remote access, site-to-site VPNs

## Optimization Devices
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic across servers (Round Robin, Least Connections)
- **Proxy Server**: Intermediary for client requests (Forward/Reverse proxies)

## Network Access Applications
- **VPN**: Secure remote access (IPsec, SSL)
- **Remote Access**: RDP, SSH, Telnet
- **Web Services**: HTTP/HTTPS, REST APIs
- **Unified Voice**: VoIP, SIP trunking

## VPN Protocols
- **IPsec**: Secure encrypted tunnels (IKE, ESP)
- **GRE**: Generic Routing Encapsulation (no encryption)
- **PPTP**: Obsolete (MS-CHAP vulnerabilities)
- **TLS/SSL**: Common in web-based VPNs

## Network Access Services
- **NIC**: Network Interface Card (Physical/MAC address)
- **RADIUS**: Centralized authentication (UDP 1812)
- **TACACS+**: Cisco alternative (TCP 49, more secure)

## DHCP
- **Servers**: Automate IP assignment (DORA process)
- **Records**: Lease database (IP/MAC bindings)
- **Dynamic DNS**: Updates DNS records automatically

## NAT (Network Address Translation)
- **Static NAT**: 1:1 mapping (public:private)
- **Dynamic NAT**: Pool of public addresses
- **PAT (Port NAT)**: Many private to single public
- **Address Types**: Public/Private, RFC 1918

## WAN Technologies

### PSTN
- **Dial-up**: 56Kbps max (POTS)
- **ISDN**: Digital (128Kbps, BRI/PRI)
- **xDSL**: Digital Subscriber Line variants:
  - ADSL: Asymmetric (faster download)
  - VDSL: Very-high-bitrate (fiber hybrid)

### Broadband
- **DOCSIS**: Cable modem standard (3.1 = 10Gbps)
- **Fiber**:
  - FTTH: Fiber to Home
  - FTTC: Fiber to Curb
  - FTTN: Fiber to Node

### Wireless
- **Cellular**: 4G LTE, 5G (mmWave)
- **WiMAX**: IEEE 802.16 (alternative to DSL)
- **Satellite**: High latency (Geostationary/LEO)

### Enterprise WAN
- **Metro Ethernet**: Ethernet over MAN
- **Leased Lines**: T1 (1.544Mbps), E1 (2.048Mbps)
- **MPLS**: Label switching for QoS
- **Frame Relay**: Legacy packet-switched
- **ATM**: Fixed 53-byte cells (obsolete)

## Network Cabling

### Twisted Pair
- **UTP**: Unshielded (Cat5/6)
- **STP**: Shielded (industrial environments)
- **Plenum**: Fire-retardant jacket
- **Cable Types**:
  - Straight-through: Host to switch
  - Crossover: Like devices
  - Rollover: Console access

### Connectors
- **RJ11**: 6P2C (phone)
- **RJ45**: 8P8C (Ethernet)
- **66/110 Block**: Punch-down blocks
- **Serial**: DB9/DB25 (legacy)

### Categories
- **Cat5**: 100MHz, 100Mbps (obsolete)
- **Cat5e**: 100MHz, 1Gbps
- **Cat6**: 250MHz, 10Gbps (55m)
- **Cat6a**: 500MHz, 10Gbps (100m)
