## Security Devices

### Firewall
Operates at Layers 2-4 and 7 with two inspection methods:
- **Stateless**: Simple packet filtering (ACLs)
- **Stateful**: Tracks connection state (more secure)

### Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
- **Signature-Based**: Matches known attack patterns
- **Anomaly-Based**: Detects deviations from baseline
- **Policy-Based**: Enforces admin-defined rules

### Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
Active system that can:
- Block malicious traffic
- Terminate connections
- Quarantine hosts
Best placed between firewall and internal network.

### VPN Concentrator
Specialized device for managing multiple VPN connections:
- Protocols: IPsec, SSL/TLS
- Functions: Authentication, encryption, access control
- Use cases: Remote access, site-to-site VPNs


## Common Network Vulnerabilities

### Telnet
A protocol used for remote login to devices, but it sends data in plaintext. Vulnerable to sniffing and man-in-the-middle attacks. It is largely replaced by SSH.

### SNMPv1 and SNMPv2
Older versions of the Simple Network Management Protocol that do not offer encryption. SNMPv3 includes secure authentication and encryption features.

### FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
Used for transferring files between systems but lacks encryption, making it vulnerable to interception of credentials and data.

### TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)
A simple, unauthenticated version of FTP used mainly in LANs. Frequently exploited due to its lack of security features.

### HTTP
Used to deliver web pages, but it transmits data in plaintext. Susceptible to interception. HTTPS should be used instead to ensure encryption.

### SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol)
An outdated protocol used to encapsulate IP packets over serial lines. It lacks error correction, encryption, and is no longer in use in modern systems.

## Vulnerable Network Practices

### Unpatched or Legacy Systems
Older systems or those missing security updates are prone to exploitation through known vulnerabilities. Maintaining patch management policies is critical.

### Open Ports
Ports that are open unnecessarily can serve as entry points for attackers. Regular port scanning and firewall policies are used to limit exposure.

### Unnecessary Running Services
Services running on systems that are not needed can increase the attack surface. These should be disabled or removed.

### Clear Text Credentials
Credentials transmitted without encryption can be intercepted using sniffing tools. Use of encryption protocols (e.g., SSH, TLS) is mandatory.

### Unencrypted Channels
Communication channels (e.g., HTTP, Telnet) without encryption allow attackers to view and manipulate data in transit.

### RF Emanation
Radio Frequency signals emitted by devices can be intercepted to extract sensitive information (e.g., keyboard input or screen data). Shielding and secured zones can mitigate this.

## Common Network Threats

### Inside Threats

#### Malicious Employee
A trusted insider with malicious intent, often exploiting their access to steal data, sabotage systems, or exfiltrate information.

#### Compromised System
A system that has been taken over by malware or remote attackers, potentially being used for launching attacks within the network.

#### Social Engineering
Psychological manipulation that tricks users into giving up confidential information or performing unsafe actions. Common forms include phishing, vishing, and baiting.

#### ARP Cache Poisoning
An attacker sends forged ARP responses to associate their MAC address with another hostâ€™s IP, enabling them to intercept, modify, or stop data intended for that host.

#### Protocol or Packet Abuse
Malicious use of networking protocols to manipulate or overload devices, such as crafting malformed packets to bypass firewalls or crash systems.

#### Man-in-the-Middle Attack
The attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.

#### VLAN Hopping
Exploiting network switch configurations to gain access to traffic on other VLANs, which are intended to be isolated from each other.

### Outside Threats

#### Zero-Day Attacks
Attacks that exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities for which no patch exists. Extremely dangerous and hard to defend against.

#### Brute Force Attacks
Systematic attempts to guess passwords or cryptographic keys by trying every possible combination.

#### Spoofing
Impersonating another device or user on a network, such as IP spoofing or email spoofing, to bypass access controls or spread malware.

#### Session Hijacking
Taking control of a user's active session by stealing or predicting session tokens, allowing attackers to impersonate them.

#### Denial of Service (DoS)

- **Traditional DoS:** Floods a target system with traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
- **Permanent DoS (PDoS):** Destroys or corrupts hardware or firmware, requiring replacement.
- **Unintentional DoS:** Caused by configuration errors or legitimate use spikes.
- **Distributed DoS (DDoS):** Coordinated attacks from multiple sources (botnets).
- **Reflective DoS:** Exploits third-party servers to reflect and amplify traffic to the victim.
  - Reflective DNS
  - Reflective NTP
- **Smurf Attacks:** Exploits ICMP and broadcast addresses to amplify attacks using spoofed source IPs.

## Wireless Network Threats

### WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)
A simplified wireless connection method that is vulnerable to brute-force attacks due to predictable PINs.

### War Driving / War Chalking
Scanning for unsecured wireless networks while driving. War chalking refers to marking these networks physically or digitally.

### WEP / WPA Cracking
Breaking weak encryption in outdated Wi-Fi protocols. WEP is especially vulnerable; WPA2 and WPA3 are preferred.

### Rogue Access Point
Unauthorized wireless access point set up to intercept traffic or lure users into connecting.

### Evil Twin Attack
A fake wireless AP mimicking a legitimate one to perform man-in-the-middle attacks on connected users.

### Bluejacking
Sending unsolicited messages to nearby Bluetooth devices. Not highly dangerous but often used to annoy or trick users.

### Bluesnarfing
Unauthorized access to data on a Bluetooth-enabled device. Can expose contacts, emails, files, etc.

## Network Hardening Techniques

Network hardening involves reducing vulnerabilities in your network infrastructure to protect against attacks and unauthorized access.

### Secure Protocols

Use **secure alternatives** to insecure network protocols:
