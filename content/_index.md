I’m an **autodidact** starting my journey in cybersecurity.  
Over the next months I’ll be building a strong foundation and documenting everything along the way.

**Work-in-progress sections:**

- 🔐 **`hacklog`** — write-ups, CTF notes, PoCs.  
- 🧠 **`learningPath`** — structured study notes, labs, and reflections.  
- 🛠️ **`projects`** — pragmatic tools in Go, Python, and c to automate recon and exploitation.
