# grayape — Personal Tech & Security Hub  
**Live site → <https://paksyy.github.io/grayape/>**

A minimalist, content-first website where I document everything. I’m currently learning the ropes as an aspiring security researcher.

## What you’ll find

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Home** | Quick intro, social links. |
| **Projects** | Small-to-mid-size tools written in GO, python, and C focused on automation, recon, and experimentation. |
| **learningPath** | Structured study notes (networking, linux, OS-internals, OWASP, etc). Checklists and mini-labs you can replicate. |
| **hacklog** | CTF write-ups, red-team notes, PoCs for interesting CVEs. Updated whenever I break (or fix) something worth sharing. |

## Stack

- **Hugo** static-site generator  
- Theme: *hello-friend-ng* (heavily tweaked, dark-mode friendly)  
- Markdown + shortcodes; no JS frameworks—fast loads, low bloat.  
- Deployed with **GitHub Pages** on every push to `main`.
